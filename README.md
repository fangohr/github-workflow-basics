Playground for re-usable workflows


Second workflow (https://github.com/fangohr/github-workflow-basics/blob/main/.github/workflows/output.yaml) triggers execution of other workflow (https://github.com/fangohr/github-workflow-basics/blob/main/.github/workflows/basic.yaml).

But the second "output" workflow cannot see the output files produced by the "basic"" workflow.

(Do we need to use artefacts?) Stopped investigation here for now.
